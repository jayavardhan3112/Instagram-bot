## Presentation
Do you want to build a network on Instagram? then you need to know how to build an Instagram Bot?
This will teach you how to automate Instagram activities with the help of an Instagram bot.

There are two ways to run the [InstaPy](https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy):
  - virtualenv
  - docker-compose

Both version used the same docker image hosted by the Docker Hub registry. We want to propose these two approaches, depending of everyone's preferences.

The `latest` tag refers to the latest released version of InstaPy

## InstaPy documentation
As mentioned above, docker image of InstaPy is built upon InstaPy released version. So, please always look first at InstaPy official repository documentation or issues. Someone else may have the same issue or question as yours!
Otherwise, you could open an issue on this repo or ask for help on Discord on the dedicated channel #docker.
